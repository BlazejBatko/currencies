# Currencies tracker

> This repository has 5 branches I created during the development of this app. 
> My goal was to make it easier for the reviewer to move between the different stages of application development.
>
> I would like to add that I am fully aware that this project could have been done in a much simpler way without the use of tools such as `react-router` or `rtk`, but I was keen to show that I am familiar with the react ecosystem.
>
> I hope you will like my implementation :)
